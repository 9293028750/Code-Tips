* EVERY CLASS NOTEBOOK
    SUMMARIZE STEPS WITH ENGLISH INSTRUCTIONS
        EG. LOAD TITANIC DATA FROM FILE TO PANDAS

    TRY TO RECONSTRUCT NOTEBOOK FROM ENGLISH INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT LOOKING AT ORIGINAL NOTEBOOK

NOTE: READING IS NEVER ENOUGH

* FOR EACH LIBRARY GO TO DOCUMENTATION
    NOTE EACH PART OF THE API WE USED IN CLASS OR DATA CAMP

    GO THROUGH THE ASSOCIATED EXAMPLES IN THE DOCUMENTATION IN YOU OWN NOTEBOOK

    LOOK AT THE HELP FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS WHEN YOU CAN THINK CALMLY THROUGH WHAT THAT MEANS

NOTE: PRACTICE USING HELP AND DOCUMENTATION

* IDENTIFY CRUCIAL PARTS/PATTERNS IN THE API
    PANDAS: ILOC/LOC, CONSTRUCTOR, JOIN, MERGE, MELT, INDEX, COLUMNS, FILL, PLOT ...

    SAME FOR SEABORN, MATPLOTLIB, NUMPY, SKLEARN, ETC. 

    MAKE YOUR OWN CHEAT SHEET





MATPLOTLIB TIP: KNOW THIS COLD
```

df = df.dropna()
df['cbwd'] = pd.get_dummies(df['cbwd'])

df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df[['year','month','day','hour']])
df_2010 = df[df['year'] == 2010]
df_2011 = df[df['year'] == 2011]
df_2012 = df[df['year'] == 2012]
df_2013 = df[df['year'] == 2013]
df_2014 = df[df['year'] == 2014]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(5, sharey=True, figsize=(5, 10))
axes[0].plot(df_2010['date'],df_2010['pm2.5'])
axes[1].plot(df_2011['date'],df_2011['pm2.5'])
axes[2].plot(df_2012['date'],df_2012['pm2.5'])
axes[3].plot(df_2013['date'],df_2013['pm2.5'])
axes[4].plot(df_2014['date'],df_2014['pm2.5'])
for ax in axes:
    ax.set_xlabel('data')
    ax.set_ylabel('pm2.5')
```

MATPLOTLIB
====================

MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE
    SCATTER PLOTS

    LINE PLOTS

    HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL BAR CHARTS

    HISTOGRAMS

    IMSHOW WITH COLORBAR

NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW JUST
    PANDAS

    MATPLOTLIB

    SEABOARN

KNOW HOW TO MAKE BASIC PLOTS IN ALL OF THEM

DO THE SAME KIND OF PLOTS IN EACH



SKLEARN DATA
====================
DATASETS A DICTIONARY

NOT THE SAME AS PANDAS

PRACTICE GOING FROM DATASETS -> PANDAS WITH COLUMNS

PRACTICE WORKING WITH CSV (PANDAS)
    COLUMNS (NAMES SHOULD APPEAR)

    DATES


SKLEARN CONSTRUCTION PATTERNS
SET UP OBJECT FOR
    CLASSIFICATION
    REGRESSION
    CLUSTERING
    DIMENSION REDUCTION

ALL CASES LEARN PARAMETERS


LEARN PATTERN CLASSIFICATION/ REGRESSION PATTERN
    BUILD OBJECT
    FIT (FOR NOW AVOID FIT TRANSFORM)
    PREDICT (TRAINING)
        MEASURE ERROR
    PREDICT (TESTING)
        MEASURE ERROR (MUST BE LARGER)


 CLUSTERING PATTERN
    BUILD OBJECT
    FIT
    PREDICT (LABELS)
    EVALUATE (INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL)
    PLOT?


DIMENSION REDUCTION
    CREATE OBJECT
    FIT
    TRANSFORM
    PLOT? (IF THERE ARE TARGET VALUES, HUE, COLORMAP IMPORTANT)


EVALUATION SUPERVISED    
    CLASSIFICATION EVALUATION:
        ACCURACY_SCORE
        CLASSIFICATION_REPORT
        ROC_AUC

    REGRESSION METRICS
        MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE)
        MEAN SQUARE ERROR (MSE OR ROOT-RMSE)


UNSUPERVISED EVALUATION
    CLUSTERING:
        SILHOUETTE SCORE
        PLOT LABELS

    DIM REDUCTION
        PLOT LABELS
        HUE BY VALUES
